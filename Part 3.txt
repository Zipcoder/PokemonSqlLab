Directions: Write a sql query or sql queries that can answer the following questions

 SELECT p.name, t.name

 * What is Rufflet's secondary type?

	
 SELECT secondary_type FROM pokemons WHERE name = "Rufflet";


* What are the names of the pokemon that belong to the trainer with trainerID 303?

	
 SELECT p.name AS pokemon_name FROM pokemons p JOIN trainers t ON p.id=t.trainerID WHERE trainerID=303;

* How many pokemon have a secondary type `Poison`?

SELECT count(*) FROM pokemons p JOIN types t ON p.secondary_type=t.id WHERE t.name='Poison';


* What are all the primary types and how many pokemon have that type?

SELECT t.name,count(p.primary_type)
    -> FROM types t
    -> JOIN pokemons p
    -> ON p.primary_type = t.id
    -> GROUP BY t.name;

* How many pokemon at level 100 does each trainer with at least one level 100 pokemone have? (Hint: your query should not display a trainer)
  SELECT COUNT(pokemon_id)
    -> FROM pokemon_trainer
    -> WHERE pokelevel = 100
    -> GROUP BY trainerID
    -> HAVING COUNT(pokelevel)>1;


 * How many pokemon only belong to one trainer and no other?
